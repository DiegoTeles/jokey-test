# JOKEY TEST


## Running the project

```
git clone https://github.com/DiegoTeles/jokey-test
cd jokey-test

npm install 
npm start
```

## What I used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend (Hooks)
  - [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as boilerplate
  - [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) as state container
  - [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as styles components
  - [React bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) as ui kit


Unfortunatelly I was unable to create any test, due to the deadline ðŸ˜”

Create auth interface and automate tests ;/

# CHALLENGE:

## Front End Evaluation

### Description
You're going to develop an app based on Chuck Norris's Jokes.
ChuckNorris.io is a very fun and lonely api that deserves to get an interface and some interaction. We're trusting you to create such a nice app, and honor Chuck Norris.

### Rules
In terms of design/layout, it's totally up to you
Pick only one of these js libs: Angular, React, Vue.js
Create a project on Github and give us (https://github.com/BeeTech-global) permission to access/clone it

### Features
You must use the 3 given endpoints and make possible users interact with them
There should be a page to query random jokes, taking into account users might want to filter by category or not
There should be a dashboard listing found jokes, like a history for users to revisit what they have seen
Other pages are optional, feel free to show off your skills

### Documentation and important links
https://api.chucknorris.io/
https://rapidapi.com/matchilling/api/chuck-norris

### Endpoints to consume
[GET] https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category={category}
[GET] https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/categories
[GET] https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/search?query={query}

### How are we gonna screen you?
Coding skills, such as logic, abstract thinking, coupling and cohesion
Use of modern tools, such as transpilers, task runners, module bundlers, libs, etc
Design patterns
Complexity and how candidates will make them as simple as possible
Tests ( unit tests, snapshop tests, e2e)
PWA techniques
Semantic HTML
Clean and well structured css

### Hints :)
Be considerate towards performance issues. Do you believe a caching strategy, CDN or local storage fits a solution? Go for it!
Avoid plugins or heavy libs like jquery
All kind of tests are very welcome
